                |  The camp didn't met my expectation... and that was awesome! I expected a lot of theory, unrelated to real projects I'm working on. Instead we've taken a look at the problems from a completely different perspective and I've received lots of useful information in that regard. At the end I have a pack of enthusiasm and ideas to try to improve things around me (not just work). Thanks for your great job and being such a positive guy!
