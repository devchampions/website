            blockquote ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Motivation ftw! It is really nice to get some exposure to people like you - makes you look into work and career at a different angle

            blockquote ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ It was very extremely helpful :) The most valuable part was the part with communication advises like wrap the negatives into sandwich, challenge people and of course 3 yes rule :)

            blockquote ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ The camp didn't met my expectation... and that was awesome! I expected another session of pair programming and TDD writing some calculator, which would be not that related to real projects I'm working on. Instead we've taken a look at the problems from a completely different perspective (soft skills) and I've received lots of useful information in that regard. Second day with discussions was great as well. At the end I have a pack of enthusiasm and ideas to try to improve things around me (not just work). Thanks for your great job and being such a positive guy!

            blockquote ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Actually the meetup exceeded my expectations. I still have a lot of things to reconsider in my life and try out. Kind of life-changing thing. Thank you!
