p Communication is a key to successful software development. But not all communication is equally valuable nor effective. Thankfully there are tools and techniques that allow improve communication when developing software. Specification by example is one of such tool. It helps facilitate more productive communication between all stakeholders involved in development of the particular project.
p This workshop will teach You how to apply specification by example to communicate more effectively. How to leverage examples to guide conversations, drive development and to create a single source of truth for testing and development.
p This workshop offers a comprehensive, hands-on introduction to specification by example, with practical exercises, work in groups and lot of fun.
