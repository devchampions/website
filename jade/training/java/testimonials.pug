                |  I wanted to know how I could improve the quality of my code and your course gave me some tools to achieve that. I liked that it was about more than writing code. You gave some tips on how to deal with management and what you can do as a developer to change that for the better and that you need to stay true to yourself. I like that the course doesn't really end's here. That there is homework and that you encourage us to stay in contact. You inspired me to become a better developer and gave me the energy to become the best that I can be.

                |  The course was absolutely above expectations. Usually courses just reuse "Clean code" book and provide some "common sense" recommendations. But not this one! More than 95% of information was top new and mind-blowing. I've got new practical tips to use in my everyday work and a completely new look on the things I do. Moreover, it inspired me for further growth as a professional and gave different directions, how to do it! Thanks, Eduard, this was the best training I ever attended!

                |  This was the most advanced and best course I've been on! Very entertaining! I learned that I should use more functional Java and that courses can be fun.
