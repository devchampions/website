p JVM deployments are common nowadays in enterprises of any size. Many of those installations handle millions of transactions per day and need tuning to their highest potential.

p This 2-day training dives deep into the JVM internals and tool set offered by JVM's eco-system. It also describes possible scenarios that may arise during production system support. Understanding of JVM internal architecture may help developers to write code that is more efficient; performance analysis and tuning of JVM parameters may help operations team to quicker find and report problems.
